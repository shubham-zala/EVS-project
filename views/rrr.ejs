                        <b>"Reducing”</b> means using less, like using fewer plastic bottles or buying products with less packaging. It's about cutting down on waste from the start.Waste production is a choice rather than a necessity.While literally producing no waste at all may be impossible, the millions of people who've endorsed the zero-waste option are rising to the challenge and reducing their personal waste production down to a fraction of what it was before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>“Reduce”</b> means not buying too many things in the first place. It's about being mindful of using resources wisely so they don't end up in a landfill.For instance, bringing your own reusable coffee cup or water bottle is an example of “reducing”. By doing this, you help cut down on the need for single-use containers and reduce waste.

                <p>
                    On World Environment Day last year, India pushed for a movement called LiFE--Lifestyle for Environment--with focus on mindful utilisation as against
                    mindless consumption of resources. Successive climate change conferences under the aegis of the United Nations lent priority to issues like biodiversity,
                    energy transition and redistribution of technology and funds, but at the core of LiFE--which India volunteered to begin at home--are people-centric actions,
                    and a new code of pro-planet behaviour.

            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li>Buying fresh food instead of packaged and processed food—or even better, starting your own garden to grow your own food.</li>
                <li>Changing all light bulbs to LED, which last far longer than other options.</li>
                <li>Buying certain food products in bulk (rice, dry beans, lentils, flour, sugar, etc.) and storing it in homemade containers.</li>
                <li>Using cloth instead of paper towels to clean up messes, and converting old cloth into cleaning rags and napkins.</li>
                <li>Composting organic matter to make soil (by weight, organic matter comprises 46 percent of the garbage the world produces, and much of it is suitable for composting)</li>
                <li>Making homemade personal care and cleaning products, without using potentially toxic chemicals.</li>

                        <b>“Recycling”</b> is the process of collecting and processing materials like paper, plastic, and glass so they can be turned into new products. It's a way to give old items a new life instead of sending them to the landfill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>"Recycling"</b> is a matter of mindset and memory.
                        On average, over 69 million tons are recycled in the United States. Paper and cardboard make up about two-thirds of all the recycled things. Next, metals are around 13%. Finally, glass, plastic, and wood together are about 4 to 5%.
                        Food waste is still a significant problem. In the United States, 30-40% of all food produced is wasted. This is a big problem because it means throwing away good food and causing environmental issues.

                        <b>“Reusing”</b> means using things again instead of throwing them away. There are a lot of creative ways that you can reuse anything in your household.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you can reuse old cardboard boxes to create fun DIY projects or as storage containers. This not only saves money but also reduces the number of boxes that end up in the trash.
                        Another example of “reuse” is using an empty glass jar to store leftovers instead of throwing them away. This way, you give the jar a second life and reduce the need for new containers.
